# Temperature-Anomaly-Analysis
Explore a City Temperature Dataset to Highlight Temperature Anomalies 

In this data project, we will compare daily average temperatures with historical averages for each city to identify outliers. We will analyze the data from 2020 and group 
outliers by region to compare which region had the most extreme weather days relative to its city count.
